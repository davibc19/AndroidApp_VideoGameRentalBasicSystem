# Title: Android App

# Description 
This project is from a discipline entitled "Software Engineering 1". It's main goal was creating an Android App (along with all documentation) about a unreal Videogame Rental Company called "Charles Xavier". In short, the app should be able to:
  - Show the user which games the Company has avaliable to renting and/or selling;
  - Let the administrator insert new users into the system;
  
It is worth mentioning that this application was developed in my third period (second year) of college. The coding wasn't that good and, I'm absolutely sure, there were better ways to do the things i've done. But, considering that in the time I hadn't any ideia of how to program in Android, had basic knowledge of Java and none about databases, I consider this a good work and a proof that I'm capable of doing what needs to be done.
